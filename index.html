            <hr class="line">
            <p>    
                 Hi! I am currently a sophomore in Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin
                 with a double major in Arts and Entertainment Technologies, and I am pursuing a technical core 
                 in Software Engineering. My coursework thus far has a bottom-up foundation, where I started by
                 learning the microarchitecture of a computer and how gates and logic relate to code. From there, I 
                 gained experience with Assembly Language (namely ARM) through Introduction to Embedded Systems while
                 also gaining experience in C through data structures in Software Design and Implementation. This past year,
                 I have ventured further into software engineering within Software Design and Implementation II, where I
                  explored more topics relating to data structures and complexity, this time while developing my skills 
                  in the Java language. This upcoming semester, I plan to take Algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I have been active in the community both within UT and in Austin by acting as a member of
                various organizations. Within UT, I am a member of the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab, where I have been
                a member of the Weather Balloon Team since February, 2020, developing various components necessary for 
                the function of a weather balloon. I am also excited to be starting as a Team Lead! Additionally, I am 
                a member of IEEE, where I act as a part of a community of electrical and computer engineers to develop the 
                ECE community at UT Austin and the promotion of professional opportunities. Beyond UT Austin, I am happy to 
                be a member of Code2College, where I am able to teach underrepresented students both in Austin and nationally
                to develop a foundation for a career in STEM through bi-weekly classes regarding computer science and its applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my past education, I attended Heritage High School in Frisco, Texas, where I enrolled AP courses
                preparing for my college education, eventually earning a title as a National AP scholar. Simultaneously,
                 I also took the Harvardx course CS50x, where I was taught the basics of coding from a variety of perspectives,
                 learning topics such as data analysis, game developement, and data structures in the languages of 
                 C, Python, SQL, and Lua.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among my interests, I am involved in music, running, weight lifting, and running. I played bass for my school 
                orchestra in high school, where I participated in Solo&Ensemble and was a member of the regional orchestra.
                 After high school, I have stayed involved by continuing my practice within both electric and standup bass, 
                 in addition to playing and developing my skills in guitar. As for running, I participated in the cross-country
                 team in high school, and I ran the Dallas Half-Marathon in December of 2018. I am proud to be a member of each
                 of these communities, and look forward to maintaining my interests!
